# SAR Image Colorization with UNet2DModel


## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image colorization model** using a **UNet2DModel**. The model transforms grayscale SAR images into their optical (colorized) counterparts, enhancing the interpretability of SAR data for various applications such as remote sensing and environmental monitoring.
